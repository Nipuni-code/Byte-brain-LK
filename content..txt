It provides the basic structure and elements of a webpage, including text content, images, links, and other multimedia elements. HTML uses a system of tags to define the structure of a webpage, with each tag representing a different element or piece of content.


CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML (or XML). It controls the layout, formatting, and appearance of elements on a webpage, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
